# Since rebar is using a single deps directory, inhereted by the top
# rebar.config, the relative path to the deps will vary. Building the
# C code requires a static relative path to libcsv, so we fetch libcsv
# here with a new rebar instance where we remove the inherited deps
# path. The deps dir is also specified in rebar-libcsv.config.
upgrade:
	@echo "Fetching libcsv into local deps dir."

# Compile the NIF. As a side-effect, the Erlang app will also be
# compiled.
